    <h2>Overview</h2>
    In this homework, I implemented a variety of techniques to reduce aliasing and enable texture mapping of geometries
    onto texel maps. In the first task, I learned to rasterize triangles by using line-tests on each of the edge. Then,
    I worked on supersampling for the second task which enabled a higher resolution sampling of the underlying geometry
    whilst also downsampling to reduce aliasing. In order to enable transformations, I learned about homogenous
    coordinates
    and applied matrix multiplication on the vertices. Lastly, in order to put finer details on the faces of the
    geometry,
    I worked on various versions of texture sampling techniques that brought sampled texels onto the original geometry
    coordinates. Throughout the homework, I found it interesting that by sampling from a mipmap level with less
    resolution
    can actually help with aliasing issues. Specifically, I thought the blurring would be more noticeable but with
    nearest
    level sampling, the finer details were still preserved. I also saw that bilinear level sampling generally didn't
    affect aliasing too well and caused some more visible blurring in areas with high contrast edges--in my opinion
    it wasn't worth the extra lerp / multiplication in some cases.


    <h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
    <h3>Rasterizing Triangles in my own Words </h3>

    First, I found the bounding box for the triangle (by taking the mins and maxes of the vertices x / y coordinates).
    Then, I found the winding order of the vertices via a cross-product test of two consecutive edges learned during
    discussion 2. In combination with the winding order, I set up the line test described in lecture 2. Looping through
    the points in the bounding box, I was able to check the middle of the points with the line tests and chose to "fill
    the pixel" in the frame buffer with the given color if all 3 line tests passed.

    <h3>A Comparison to Other Rasterization Techniques</h3>

    Our algorithm loops through each of the sample points within the bounding box of the triangle. For each of the
    sample,
    we use constant time calculations for determining whether or not it resides within the bounds of edges by
    implementing
    3 of the line tests as discussed in lecture. In this way, our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample
    within the bounding box of the triangle. Although it was possible to implement some type of incremental or tiled
    triangle traversal, there wasn't a particular framework provided to do parallel computations of point-in-triangle
    tests and it would also incur additional branching costs for determining whether or not the algorithm has reached a
    boundary and needs to redirect.

    <h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>

    <h3>Supersampling Walkthrough</h3>

    In order to super sample, I first made sure to modified how <code>sample_buffer</code> was initialized and resized
    to also
    multiply the <code>sample_rate</code> since each pixel refers to <code>sample_rate</code> additional pixels now.
    Then, during the
    rasterization stage, I used the updated sample_rates to subdivide the pixel region and update sample_buffer using
    the new indexing method of \[ (y * sqrt\_sample\_rate + j) * width * sqrt\_sample\_rate + x * sqrt\_sample\_rate + i
    \]
    Lastly, when resolving to the final frame buffer, I took the average of all the supersamples corresponding to a
    pixel; in
    other words, I down sampled for the final frame.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Super sampling is useful because the latter downscaling step averages out the samples within a pixel which
    effectively antialiased the triangle edges and reduces the amount/impact of jaggies.

    Before super sampling, the very left tip of the red triangle had a disconnected and uncharacteristic straight line
    of pixels. This was due to the sampling locations being very close to the triangle boundaries which made neighboring
    samples sometimes being out/in the boundary even though the majority of the region the pixel occupies was mostly
    triangle/not. With super sampling, we take the average of multiple samples within a pixel which is able to
    encapsulate the super fine tip a lot better.

    <h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
    <h3>Cubeman Waving</h3>

        <figcaption>Cubeman Waving
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    I'm not that creative, so I just tried making Cubeman do a little wave. To do this, I adjusted the translation
    transforms for the arms since the rotations would make them start and end at slightly different places. Then, I
    added two layers of rotates to create two joints for the shoulder and elbow. It was really cool to me that SVG
    can be constructed by layering multiple types of transforms.

    <h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
    <h3>Barycentric Coordinates Overview</h3>

        <figcaption>Smoothly Blended Triangle
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    Barycentric coordinates estimate the proportional distance for a point on a given line. In the case of this
    triangle, the barycentric coordinate would encapsulate the proportional distance a point lies on the line between a
    vertex and the opposite edge of the triangle in all three directions. Since the 3 parameters for the barycentric
    coordinate each estimates how far a point is from the edges, we can create a smoothly blended color triangle by
    using the barycentric parameters as weights for the color contribution from each vertex.

    <h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>

    <h3>Pixel Sampling Overview</h3>

    Pixel sampling is the idea of mapping a non-integer location onto a grid of values. In the context of texture
    mapping, we are able to find the exact position of where to source from the texture map but the texture map itself
    is still in a grid of values. Thus, there are two sampling methods we can use. The first method we used was the
    "nearest" method which finds the closest pixel in the texel to the texture coordinate. Next is the bilinear
    filtering method which finds the 4 nearest pixels and averages the values using a linear interpolation of the
    distances between the exact location and the 4 nearest neighbors.

    <h3>Nearest Sampling vs. Bilinear Sampling</h3>

    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
        <table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
            <tr>
                <td style="text-align: center;">

                    <figcaption>Nearest Pixel Sampling with 16x SS</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/task5/3.png" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption>Bilinear Pixel Sampling with 1x SS</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/task5/4.png" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption>Bilinear Pixel Sampling with 16x SS</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <br/>

    In the above examples, the nearest sampling gave a lot more defined edges and jaggies. This was smoothed out at 16
    pixel sampling but was very visible in the 1 pixel sampling since it was possible for a slightly slanted line to
    have some disconnects. With bilinear filtering, this problem was more so removed since it was more likely that a
    sampled texture location of a point on a line would have 4 neighbors with at least one containing the color of the
    line even if it is not directly the nearest neighbor. Thus, any clearly identifiable lines and high contrast regions
    would prove the bilinear filtering method to have better results.

    <h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
    <h3>Level Sampling Overview</h3>

    Level sampling is a way to utilize mipmaps inside of texture mapping. Mipmaps are a multi-layer representation of a
    texture image where each subsequent layer is downsampled from the previous. Then, to estimate which level is
    appropriate to use for a specific geometry in the scene, it is possible to estimate the impact of the texture by
    seeing how far the neighboring texture samples are.Using these concepts, I mapped neighboring pixel samples to the
    texture coordinates and used the lecture formulas for D / L estimations.

    <h3>Difference in Implemented Techniques</h3>

    In the context of texture mapping, changing the pixel sampling method from nearest pixel to bilinear pixel
    interpolation would incur additional performance cost of calculating the lerp between the 4 nearest neighbors and
    the 4 texel reads needed to get the corresponding neighbor values. This does not increase memory usage. As shown in
    the previous task, this does improve anti aliasing power since higher contrast areas are averaged out and
    contribution of each pixel is more likely to be accounted for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By enabling level sampling, we are committed to generating and storing the mipmaps for each texel which would
    increase the memory usage and decrease the upfront speed. Once the mipmaps are ready, there are additional
    performance costs since there is the need to estimate the level for which each texel is set to appear at. With
    nearest level and bilinear level sampling, the anti aliasing power is like that of supersampling since each level is
    calculated via down-sampling.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Supersampling, with the naive sample buffer method, increases both the computational cost and memory usage for the
    rendering pipeline. This is because at each sample we are taking 4, 9, 16x additional samples of the base geometry.
    This incurs the corresponding amounts of additional line tests whilst also having the need to store the additional
    samples. Lastly, at the frame buffer transformation stage, an average is needed. Still, this downsampling stage
    allows supersampling to effectively increase the resolution of the rendering which reduces aliasing.

    <h3>Visual Comparison</h3>

                    <img src="images/task6/3.png" width="400px"/>

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <br/>

    In the above visualization, a few things to notice when applying the different transformations are:
    <ul>
        <li>the jaggies on the large crack running up the length of the building</li>
        <li>the forefront corner of the building has ledge-like features where the edge suddenly shifts</li>
        <li>moire pattern near the top of the building</li>
    </ul>
    After applying bilinear pixel sampling, it seemed like the jaggies near the front of the image were less noticeable.
    However, the moire pattern near the top still seemed very much present. With both level sampling and 16x supersampling,
    it seemed like both of the aliasing issues seem to be resolved.
